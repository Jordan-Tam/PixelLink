It is played on a square board containing 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. The players, referred to as 'White' and 'Black', each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns; each type of piece has a different pattern of movement. An enemy piece may be captured (removed from the board) by moving one's own piece onto the square it occupies; the object of the game is to 'checkmate' (threaten with inescapable capture) the enemy king. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.",

Ports for Android and iOS were released on September 26, 2024. In the game, the player plays poker hands from a starting 52-card deck to score points and defeat blinds in a limited number of turns. Subsequent blinds become more difficult to beat, but the player can acquire joker and other cards, purchased from a shop with randomized offerings between blinds, that provide unique effects that impact play and scoring or the means to change the composition of their deck to give themselves an advantage.",
