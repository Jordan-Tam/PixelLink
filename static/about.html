    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        Here at PixelLink, we believe social connections are a human need. There are thousands of people out there who wish they could play and discuss their gaming interests with others, but either don't know anybody who shares many of their interests, are having trouble searching for that perfect, compatible match, or are simply too shy to engage with people in real life but are nonetheless eager to build friendship online. Our intention with this web application is to provide these individuals with the solution to this social problem.
